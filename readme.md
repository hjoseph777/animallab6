# Animal Care Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a simple Java application that demonstrates the use of inheritance and polymorphism through an animal care system. The project includes various animal classes that extend a base `Animal` class and showcase different behaviors.

## Class Synopsis

### [AnimalCare.java](src/main/java/com/me/animalcare/AnimalCare.java)
The `AnimalCare` class contains the `main` method, which serves as the entry point of the application. It demonstrates the creation and usage of different animal objects, including `Dog`, `Parrot`, and `Cat`. The class showcases polymorphism by calling methods on the base `Animal` type and specific animal types.

### [Animal.java](src/main/java/com/me/animalcare/Animal.java)
The `Animal` class is an abstract base class that defines common properties and methods for all animals, such as `birthYear`, `breed`, `weight`, and behaviors like `walk` and `talk`. It also includes subclasses like `Dog`, `Parrot`, and `Cat`, each with their own specific behaviors and properties.

## Resume
In this exercise, we created a Java application that demonstrates the principles of inheritance and polymorphism. We defined a base `Animal` class and extended it with specific animal classes like `Dog`, `Parrot`, and `Cat`. The `AnimalCare` class serves as the entry point of the application, where we instantiate and interact with these animal objects, showcasing their unique behaviors.
